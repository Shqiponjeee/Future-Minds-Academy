            <p>Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982),
                and her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993),
                followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995).
                Her biggest commercial successes include the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014), its 2019 sequel, and the
                superhero film Eternals (2021).</p>
